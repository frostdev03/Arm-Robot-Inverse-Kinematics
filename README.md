### Arm Robot

A robotic arm is a type of mechanical arm that functions similarly to a human arm but with actuated joints, which allow it to move and perform tasks. It is designed to mimic the range of motion of a human arm, including movements such as reaching, grasping, lifting, and manipulating objects. A robotic arm typically consists of several segments, or "links," connected by joints that are powered by motors (usually servo motors), hydraulic systems, or pneumatic actuators.
